/**
 * Animal avatar types — see AVATAR-SYSTEM.md §2.
 *
 * Each launch animal ships as a `react-native-svg` render function that
 * accepts animation drivers for the eye + mouth elements. The renderer
 * wraps the result in an Animated.View for breathing, so the rest of
 * the app composes via the `<AvatarRenderer />` primitive and never
 * touches per-animal markup directly.
 *
 * The 12 launch animals are placeholder art lifted from
 * `speakeasy-animals.html`. Spec §1 calls them "not shippable" but the
 * user has explicitly opted in to ship them as MVP — replace post-
 * illustrator without changing the contract here.

 * gesture amplitude, signature pose.

 * prop (zustand-driven re-renders at 30 Hz) without each consumer
 * having to wire its own Animated.Value handles.

 * (everything else stays at neutral defaults).

 * `eventAt` is the receiver's local clock at the moment the event
 * arrived — used to tick the one-shot pose overlay's ~1.5 s
 * lifetime against the receiver's clock so sender/receiver clock
 * drift doesn't shorten or extend it.
